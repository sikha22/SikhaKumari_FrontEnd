Explain what the simple List component does.

This is a simple List component that displays a list of items, with the ability to select one item at a time. 
The list items are rendered using the SingleListItem component, which receives props for the text of the item, 
its index in the list, whether it is currently selected, and a click handler to be called when the item is clicked.

The WrappedSingleListItem component is used as a memoized wrapper around the SingleListItem component to optimize 
rendering performance, by only re-rendering when the props change.

The WrappedListComponent is the main List component that receives an array of items as a prop. It maintains the 
currently selected index state using the useState hook and sets it to null whenever the list of items changes using the useEffect hook.

The handleClick function is called whenever a list item is clicked and updates the selectedIndex state accordingly. The map function is
used to iterate through the list of items and render a SingleListItem component for each item, passing the necessary props.

Finally, the List component is memoized using the memo function to optimize rendering performance, by only re-rendering when its props
change. The propTypes and defaultProps are also defined to ensure that the component is used correctly and to provide default values when necessary.
